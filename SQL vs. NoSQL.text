# SQL Databases 
Structured Query Language databases are relational databases. We pre-define a schema of TABLES before we insert anything 

# No-SQL Databases 
NoSQL databases do not use SQL.
There are many types of no-sql databases, including document, key-value, and graph stores. 
        -No need to follow a predefine a schema 
        -No "tables"
